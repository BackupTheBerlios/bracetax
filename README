A simple syntax for wiki and Co...

BUILD:
ocamlbuild -I src/app -I src/lib  src/app/main.byte


TODO:
* A lib:
    * Parser functor
    * XHTMLWriter
    * LaTeX_writer
* A demo application:
    * bracetax -html  -i file.brtx -o -

TESTS:
* use the application

PACKED LIB:
When time will come (and a good name too), for packing, create a file 
wonderfull_name.mlpack in scr/lib with the list of modules

SYNTAX (changes along dev):

{cmd arg1 arg2|Parsable text of the command}

{cmd-without-text}

# Comment to the end of the line (only in P-Text)

In P-Text, {{}, {}} {#} are commands.

In args: _ is the empty arg (convention), 
'\\' escapes '\' 
'\ ' escapes ' ' 
?? '\t' '\n' '\r' escape themselves ;-)
'\|' escapes '|'

Should read {...| at once and then say cmd(arg1, .. , argn)
