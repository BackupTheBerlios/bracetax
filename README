A simple syntax for wikis and more...

BUILD:
  ./mk


DOCUMENTATION:
Launch the generation (needs bracetax and pdflatex in the $PATH):
  ./mk d
And open gendoc/index.html


NEXT:

Macro system:

    M4 ?
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M4_(computer_language)

    {macro my_macro arg1 arg2}
    Code of the macro {arg arg1} {contents} {arg arg2}
    {end}
    

Include verbatim or not:

    M4 ?
    
    {include /path/to/file}
    {verbatiminput /path/to/file}
    
    => include and macro are non-wiki features maybe keep m4 for thesis/authoring but not in core bracetax


Characters:
    {...} -> dots/hellip
